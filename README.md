# 🏛️ Naatukadha AR 🌿

**Digitizing Kerala’s Cultural Soul**

Naatukadha AR is a web platform dedicated to preserving, reviving, and refreshing the rich cultural heritage of Kerala. Built with modern web technologies, the platform brings the essence of Kerala—its music, cuisine, and traditions—closer to everyone, anywhere.

> ⚠️ Note: Originally, we started an AR version using [Viro React](https://github.com/Ajay-Krishna00/Naattukadha_AR), which is compatible only with specific versions of React Native. Certain features like folk song downloads and dynamic restaurant searches weren’t feasible in AR, so we developed this web version to include them.
